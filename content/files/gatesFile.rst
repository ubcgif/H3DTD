Time Gates File
===============

When predicting synthetic field data (forward modeling) with **h3dtd_v2.exe**, the time gates file defines the times in which the receivers measure the TEM data. The time gates file is comprised of a single column denoting the observation times in seconds, i.e.:


|
| :math:`t_1`
| :math:`t_2`
| :math:`t_3`
| :math:`\, \vdots`
| :math:`\, \vdots` 
| :math:`t_n`
